How to run the app

1. ```npm run build```
2. ```npm run on-docker``` (app will run on docker)
3. ```npm run test```
4. ```npm run start``` (and then input the file name in files folder)

Notes: I installing mocha and chai not in dev dependency, the reason is because the user will run test in docker
